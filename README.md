# MyNeuralNetwork
A fully connected neural network. Working on the Cifar10 data. Only made using Numpy

## Training
This is for a 2 hidden layer network with 300 and 250 neuraons respectively. Cross Entropy was used

The Graph progression can be seen below for the loaded weights. Unfortunately these loaded weights only achieved a validation accuracy of 47.94 before google collab crash.

## Testing
Unfortunately due to google collab disconnect issue the netwrok could not be trained for higher accuracies. The following are the images of the validation accuracy and loss from sample model. For sample network we did save the parameters using pickle which is what we've loaded and used to give the training accuracy and prediction in the cells below.
